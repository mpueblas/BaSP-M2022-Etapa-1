## WEEK 02
We wrote the html code for the landing page of Trackgenix. With non css design code, just the semantics for the estructure.

## WEEK 03
We wrote the Css code giving the visual style to the page. We don`t use any flexbox code, just pure Css.

## WEEK 04
We re-wrote the Css code using Flex-box and some Media-queries to make an responsive page. We take four different screen sizes to design the layouts. 

## WEEK 05
We started to learn the first programming language of the course, Java Script. We resolved excercises in six different .js files. Finally we fix the errors of previous weeks.

## WEEK 06
We used the week ones Figma design like sketch to make our Sign Up and Log In pages. For the estructure we used HTML, CSS for the style issues and we started to apply Java Script to give functionality to our forms.

## WEEK 07
We use the query params to make an URL with the form information on it. Then we use the fetch function to make HTML request with that URL, and use the received data to set it in the Local Storage.
